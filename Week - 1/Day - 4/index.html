        Local health officials look for normalcy, policy changes in the new year

        Michigan’s public health, food and sanitary codes are among policy focus
        areas for local health officials in the new year.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Michigan Association for Local Public Health (MALPH) said lately
        it’s seen increased threats that could weaken the power of health
        leaders.
      </p>
      <p>
        Executive director Norm Hess said he’d like lawmakers to make it easier
        to understand what public health officials do.
      </p>
      <p>
        “It’s a very, very long document, the public health code. And I think
        that some of it is just cleaning up some of the language that is
        confusing or difficult for people to really comprehend,” Hess told
        reporters during a roundtable discussion Tuesday.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hess said discussions around the food code that are also still very
        early would likely fall outside of the state Department of Health and
        Human Services’ purview. But they could potentially address changes in
        the marketplace like the rise of food trucks or pop-up restaurants.
      </p>
      <p>
        He said creating a statewide sanitary code could clean up what’s
        currently a patchwork of local regulations surrounding wastewater
        treatment and other areas.
      </p>
      <p>
        During Tuesday’s roundtable, Hess also brought up that the state has
        seen around a third of its public health officers leave their jobs
        within the last three years.
      </p>
      <p>
        Officials say that’s because of a combination of scheduled retirements,
        comparatively lower wages, and fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic.
      </p>
      <p>Hess said the field needs to attract new talent.</p>
      <p>
        “We are in conversations frequently with schools of public health as
        well as even community colleges. You know, not many people wake up in
        the sixth grade and say, ‘When I grow up, I want to be a public health
        officer.’ Because they just don’t know what that means,” Hess said.
      </p>
      <p>
        Public health officers lead local health departments and put policies in
        place to address community needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        MALPH leadership stressed how that relationship between those
        departments and the general public became strained during the pandemic.
      </p>
      <p>
        Organization president Jimena Loveluck said childhood vaccinations are
        down and other services have trailed off.
      </p>
      <p>
        “I think it’s really part of what we’re focusing on in local public
        health is getting back to those public health services that we weren’t
        able to focus on as much during the height of COVID because we
        redirected all of our resources pretty much to address COVID,” Loveluck
        said.
      </p>
      <p>
        She blamed part of that strained relationship between health departments
        and the public on the limited resources available for pandemic response.
